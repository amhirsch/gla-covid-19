# Los Angeles County COVID-19 data collection
This project aims to collect data related to COVID-19 from Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.
The data is scraped from the daily COVID-19 briefings published by the department.
An archive of these documents can be found [here](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediaCOVIDdisplay.cfm?unit=media&ou=ph&prog=media)

## Cases by Region
Collecting data at the county level is advantageous as the local health department releases statistics on COVID-19 cases by area.
Such areas are broken down by cities, subsets of the City of Los Angeles, and unincorporated areas.
The geographic boundaries are published at the [County of Los Angeles GIS Portal](https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/countywide-statistical-areas-csa).
The regions are defined by the Los Angeles Times' [**Mapping L.A.**](http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/) project.
